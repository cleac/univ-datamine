# Lab 1

Implements lab 1 from image processing course. 

### How to run
Since there is some libraries needed to run it, run those steps to run the lab
```bash
virtualenv --clear --prompt="[lab1]" .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can just type `python main.py`. It could take some time to transform picture so I have already provided resized one.

### What does it does

It implements resizing of [picture](pic1.jpg) on billinear interpolation algorythms.

### File walkthrough

*not needed - everything is in main.py file*
